# License Plate Recognition with YOLOv11 Object Detection &amp; OpenCV

## Overview

End-to-end computer vision project implementing an **automatic license plate recognition (ALPR)** pipeline using a custom-trained YOLOv11 model for detection and an OCR module for character recognition. The system detects license plates in vehicle images, crops them, and decodes plate text for use in automated traffic monitoring, parking management, and security applications.

The pipeline integrates deep learningâ€“based object detection with optical character recognition, handling preprocessing, model inference, and post-processing to deliver accurate plate text output even under varied lighting and angle conditions.

## Features

- Custom YOLOv11 model trained for license plate detection
- Plate cropping and image preprocessing with OpenCV morphological transformations for OCR
- Integrated EasyOCR into pipeline to read license plate content
- Handles multiple detections and recognitions per image

## Learning Outcomes

- Training and fine-tuning YOLOv11 models on custom data
- Preprocessing image crops for optimal OCR accuracy
- Unified pipeline with YOLOv11 object detection, image preprocessing with OpenCV, and EasyOCR utilization
- Evaluating YOLOv11 model performance using mAP for detection and accuracy for recognition
- Deployed Gradio demo on Huggingface Spaces
